## HTML5 Structure

The objective of this task is to organize content using HTML5 structural tags.

You are not expected to complete this in one session. What you do not finish in class, spend time practicing at home. Always start from the beginning. Do not copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.

## Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking the "Clone or Download" button, then select "Download ZIP".

Included in the directory on your computer are the following files:

- 300.png
- 400.png
- 600.png
- article.html
- index.html
- README.md (this file)
- style.css

### Here is what you need to do

**All work needs to be done in the `exercise-06` folder.** (It may be named `exercise-06-master`.)

DO NOT add the style sheet until the very end. (If I catch any pairs using the style sheet, I will make you start over.)

Begin this exercise with `index.html`.

1. Validate the HTML. Are there any mistakes before you begin?  Make sure nothing is broken when running the code through a validator and viewing it in the browser.

2. Identify the information at hand. Before you start adding tags, either print out a copy of this page or draw your own template as to how the HTML/content should be grouped into different structural components. (There are a couple ways you might approach this.)

3. When you have finished adding HTML5 structural tags, validate your code again to be sure you have not introduced any errors.

4. Add the following line to the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<link src="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

If your page has been structured properly, you should see the structural components boxed and highlighted in different grays. In some cases, you will see boxes within boxes.

5. Repeat the steps above with `article.html`.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
